Are you a UTA in Imperial College's DoC?

If so you may enjoy this repo.

This is a nice simple Python script for managing students' code locally.

You can:
  - Neatly clone all your students' code with one command, 'uta fetch LabExercisename'.
  - Print students' code automatically, in the same two-column format as the old UTA-Utils: 'uta print -p studentLogin11'.

NOTE the --all option (to diff/print all students' code) doesn't currently work. the only way to use this stuff is to be in the dir above and pass a student's login to the commands.

Soon it will do more, and hopefully get prettier as well...
