The idea of these utilities is simple.

- parseAutotest, given an autotest results file as an argument, makes a
  directory within the current directory for each student, and fills each one
  with their source files plus a file for tests/results. It also produces
  a printable .ps version of each, using enscript.

- printAutotest, with the optional argument -p to make it print straight away,
  generates a pdf file per student from all their files' generated postscript
  versions, and optionally (given -p) prints these directly to ICTMono, syntax
  highlighted and separately stapled in landscape (two columns)

Yes, I know the code is awful. It was hacked together in half an hour when I
got the first submission and realized their page-break-splitting print utility
thing wasn't good enough.

If you want to refactor it into something nice and can actually be bothered,
please do.

At least it works :).
