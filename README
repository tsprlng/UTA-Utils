Are you a UTA in Imperial College's DoC?

If so you may enjoy this repo.

This is a nice simple Python script for managing students' code locally.

Currently all it does is let you neatly clone all your students' code with one command, 'uta fetch LabExercisename'.

Soon it will do more, and hopefully get prettier as well...
